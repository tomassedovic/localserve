localserve
==========

Sometimes you have a static HTML site and all you want to do is view it in the
browser without mucking about with your webserver configuration or `file:///`
URLs (that break absolute paths and prevent AJAX from working properly).

How about you just `cd` into the website directory, type `localserve` and
start browsing the site instead?

Also, it's like super easy to install.

Requirements
------------
A reasonably recent version of Python 2 or 3.

Installation
------------
1. Place the `localserve` executable on your `$PATH`.
2. There's no step 2.
